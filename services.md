## Video Production

We offer a complete video production package, from concept through to final delivery. Our standard production process is as follows:

* Pre-Production:
  * Planning: we will meet with you and discuss your ideas and needs, in order to establish a set of key messages for your video
  * Storyboarding: we will produce a proffessional storyboard to layout the structure and story of the video
* Production:
  * Equipment: we have a selection of high quality production equipment available for use. For more information, see our [equipment page](/equipment)
  * Filming Days: we have experience running filming days in a multitude of environments
* Post-Production:
  * Paper Edit: we aim to complete a paper edit within 48 hours of the final shoot day, including interview transcripts and a-roll footage
  * Rough Draft: with input from our client, we use the paper edit to create a rough draft. This is the underlyingÂ  storyline of the video, focusing entirely on the narrative and pacing.
  * Polished Draft: once the rough draft has been approved, we add supporting elements such as graphics and music, and implement colour correction, grading and sound design
  
### Unlimited Revisions

As part of our process, we offer unlimited revisions over the post-production window. This allows our clients to ensure that they are completely happy with each stage of production.

## Graphic Design

We have experience working with vector graphic applications to create proffessional looking logos and graphics.
