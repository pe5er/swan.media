## Video Production

We offer a complete video production package, from concept through to final delivery. Our standard production process is as follows:

* __Step 1:__ Pre-Production:
  * Planning: we will meet with you and discuss your ideas and needs, in order to establish a set of key messages for your video.
  * Storyboarding: we will produce a professional storyboard to layout the structure and story of the video.
* __Step 2:__ Production:
  * Equipment: we believe in using high quality production equipment, and will always film in 6K as standard. For more complex projects we will hire in additional equipment and crew as needed.
  * Timing: when filming events, we like to arrive as early as possible to setup, if not the day before. We will make arrangements as to timing and any other logistics related to the shoot.
* __Step 3:__ Post-Production:
  * Rough Draft: we aim to complete a rough draft within 48 hours of the final shoot day when possible, in order to recieve client feedback early into the editing process. At this stage the focus is mostly on the content and pacing of the edit.
  * Polished Draft: once the rough draft has been approved, we add supporting elements such as graphics and music, and implement colour correction, grading and sound design
  * Final Delivery: once the polished draft has been approved, we will do any final touch ups and then deliver you a high-quality output file. We can help with uploading the video as well!
