## Video Production

We offer a complete video production package, from concept through to final delivery. Our standard production process is as follows:

* __Step 1:__ Pre-Production:
  * Planning: we will meet with you and discuss your ideas and needs, in order to establish a set of key messages for your video
  * Storyboarding: we will produce a professional storyboard to layout the structure and story of the video
* __Step 2:__ Production:
  * Equipment: we have a selection of high quality production equipment available for use. For more information, see our [equipment page](/equipment)
  * Filming Days: we have experience running filming days in a multitude of environments, and can cope with different lighting and weather conditions.
* __Step 3:__ Post-Production:
  * Paper Edit: we aim to complete a paper edit within 48 hours of the final shoot day, including interview transcripts and a-roll footage
  * Rough Draft: with input from our client, we use the paper edit to create a rough draft. This is the underlying  storyline of the video, focusing entirely on the narrative and pacing.
  * Polished Draft: once the rough draft has been approved, we add supporting elements such as graphics and music, and implement colour correction, grading and sound design
